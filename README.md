Summary of Project
-
The Los Amigos Project is a simple project which aims to enable students to utilize the Java programming language efficiently and correctly, teaching them new concepts and allowing them to use their creativity to solve a range of different tasks and problems. Particularly, this Java project manages a basketball team's roster, using parallel arrays for the names, ages, and points of the players. Some key tasks include finding the oldest and youngest players, calculating the maximum and minimum points as well as the point range, and sorting arrays using bubble sort while keeping the parallel arrays aligned. Additionally, it optimizes the starting lineup by swapping the starter player with the lowest points with the reserve player with the highest points in order to maximize total points, and also swaps any players that are older than the average age in order to ensure that the youngest and most capable players are being utilised.
